# HAR2LoliCode: Advanced LoliCode Generator

HAR2LoliCode is a powerful web-based utility designed to streamline the creation of OpenBullet 2 configurations by analyzing HTTP Archive (HAR) files. It helps developers and security researchers automatically generate LoliCode scripts from captured network traffic, saving hours of manual work.

## Key Features

- **HAR File Parsing**: Upload and process HAR files from any browser's developer tools.
- **Dependency Analysis**: Automatically analyzes the dependency graph between requests based on cookies, redirects, and referrers.
- **Automated Token Detection**: A sophisticated token analyzer scans requests and responses to find potential security tokens (like CSRF tokens, session IDs, and JWTs).
- **Interactive Token Suggestions**: Detected tokens are presented in the UI, allowing users to instantly create variable extraction rules for the LoliCode script with a single click.
- **Visual Dependency Graph**: Visualize the relationships between network requests to better understand complex user flows.
- **Interactive LoliCode Customization**:
    - Select which requests to include in the final script.
    - Add custom variable extraction rules based on token analysis suggestions.
    - Configure global settings like timeouts and proxy usage.
- **Real-time LoliCode Preview**: See the generated LoliCode script update in real-time as you customize the configuration.
- **AI-Powered Refinement**: Optionally use AI to refine and improve the generated LoliCode for clarity and performance.

## How to Use

1.  **Upload HAR File**: Go to the main page and upload a `.har` file captured from your browser.
2.  **Process & Analyze**: The application will parse the file and automatically analyze the request dependencies and detect tokens.
3.  **Explore the Dashboard**:
    - View the list of all requests and filter them as needed.
    - Examine the **Detected Tokens** panel to see what the analyzer found.
    - Click the **"+ Add Variable"** button next to a token to automatically create a variable extraction rule.
4.  **Customize Your Script**:
    - Select the requests you want to include in your script.
    - Fine-tune variable extractions and other settings in the Generator tab.
5.  **Generate & Download**: Once you are satisfied, generate the final LoliCode script and either copy it to your clipboard or download it as a file.
